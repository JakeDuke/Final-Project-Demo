# DJFinder Demo

Welcome to DJFinder Demo!

DJFinder is a fullstack application to find your favourite artist (DJ, musician, etc) for your next event. 
Artist details are stored in the backend, database by using IDs. Users can use the service via index.html on the front end. 
Whether its a private party or a public party, DJFinder makes it easier to find the right artist for you for the right party.

### Prerequisites

 use express, vue , cors dependencies via npm install. npm install "name". 

### Getting started

This is how it works:

1. Run index.js file found on the gh- main page via node on the CLI, navigate to the right file via CLI and open index.html to use the service. 
2. Fill out all the details about your desired artist: Style, budget, dates and location. 
3. Click submit and the site will return registered artists within the target area that match your budget, music style and dates.
4. Visit the artist profile and see the details about specific DJ or musician. 
5. If you like all the details about the person, you can request the artist directly by clicking "Book Me". 
That will send the artist an email about received request. 
6. The artist has 24h to reply to the request by clicking confirmed, deny or pre-confirm with changed details such as different dates.
7. Once artist has confirmed his or her request, a user will receive a confirmation email. 
8. The confirmation email reveals the artists contact info such as phone # for faster communication. 
9. Get ready for the party, your artist is booked!

## What we learned from this project

Christian: I have learned about how to build a website with HTML CSS and JS. How to add API to talk with the backend. Calendar has been added via CSS. Google Maps is integrated via API. Soundcloud link is provided to directly access artist's soundcloud for music samples. 
I have learned how to require different files in the index.js folder and interact with them to make it a fullstack application.
Although its simple, it works.
